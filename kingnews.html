            <p>Few weeks ago the Dein Of Agbor said that there are only two first class kings in Delta State. The Olu of Warri and Himself.
                The Delta state council of chiefs went after him furiously as if he lied.</p>

        <p><h3>IS THERE TWO CLASSES OF KINGS IN THE STATE?</h3>
            The answer to this question is a sounding yes. There are two classes of traditional rulers in delta state and they are;</p>
            
            <p>
            1. FRIST CLASS KINGS. - These are kings that their kingdom existed before the days of colonialism. Their kingdom and kingship were established before the British created Warrant and paramount chiefs to help them with indirect rule.</p>
            
            <p>
            2. 2nd Class Kings. - These set of kings were created by either the British or Nigerian government. Their kingdom were illegally carved out from Pre Existing kingdom or carved out from pre existing kingdom as a result of the people agitating for self rule.</p>
            
            <p>
            When the British government were looking for ways to rule over the area now known as Nigeria they created Warrant chiefs out of no where and made some Paramount Chiefs to help them in administrative duties. Some of these chiefs metamorphose into traditional rulers in the domain they where administering. Also, in modern day Nigeria governments have been creating kingdoms and kings as tools in achieving their political aims.  All but two of the kings in Delta state falls under the 2nd class kings.</p>
