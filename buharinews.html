            <p class="p">President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday received His Royal Majesty, 
                Ogiame Atuwatse III, five months after his coronation as the Olu of Warri.
                Speaking at the State House in Abuja while receiving the monarch and
                 some of his chiefs, the President pledged a fair deal to the Itsekiri 
                 people of Delta State.
                “I am grateful for your visit and impressed by your patriotism.
                 I have taken note of your requests, and will work on them as soon
                  as politically possible,” Buhari was quoted as 
                saying in a statement issued by his spokesman, Femi Adesina.
            </p>

        <p >In his remarks, the Olu of Warri said the visit was
             to primarily thank the President for sending a high-powered 
             delegation to his coronation as the 21st monarch of the Kingdom, 
            “and for your kind felicitation, goodwill and solidarity.”</p>

        <p>He also reiterated the loyalty of the Itsekiri people to 
                “one united Nigeria, as we support your government’s aspiration 
                to provide security and economic 
                prosperity to all Nigerians, irrespective of tribe, creed or religion.”</p>

       <p>While describing President Buhari as “a dogged patriot and fervent
                     believer in Project Nigeria,” the Olu drew attention to what he called
                      “some burning issues that are dear to our hearts.”
                    The issues included the under-utilization of the four ports 
                    in Warri, Koko, Sapele, and Burutu, all in Delta State, 
                    reconstitution of the NDDC Board, immortalizing the first Finance
                     Minister of the country, Chief Festus Okotie-Eboh, and resuscitation 
                    of the Ogidigben EPZ Project, which has reportedly been abandoned.</p>

        <p>On the NDDC Board, he said he believed the President would
                         soon reconstitute it, “as an interested party, we 
                         genuinely want a better deal for us in the Niger Delta, 
                         as we believe charity begins at home. By this, we mean 
                         that we Niger Deltans must be ready to put the 
                         betterment of our people first in all we do. Putting 
                         our people first is the only way to make our lives better.”
                        On the entourage of the Olu of Warri were Chiefs Brown Mene, Oma Eyewuoma, Thomas Ereyitomi, Daniel Reyeju, Dere Awosika, and Mr Julius Rone.</p>
